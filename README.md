# HelloðŸ˜Š , its nices to see you here!!

Here I have design and develop a simple personal organiser system in Python for
recording and maintaining of modules in my University of Greenwich. 

 I have maintained a list of available modules in a table called modules, which includes :
 
A. add a module to the list of available modules

This feature allows the user to enter the module code and name, and prompts the user if the
module code already exists;

B. edit an existing module

This feature allows the user to select a module from the module list and edit its namecode;

C. delete an existing module

this feature allows the user to select a module from the module list then delete the record from file.
