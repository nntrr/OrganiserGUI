# HelloðŸ˜Š , its nices to see you here!!

Here I have design and develop a simple personal organiser system in Python for
recording and maintaining of modules in my University of Greenwich. 

 I have maintained a list of available modules in a table called modules, which includes :
 
A. add a module to the list of available modules
this feature should allow the user to enter the module code and name, and should prompt the user if the
module code already exists;

B. edit an existing module
this feature should allow the user to select a module from the module list and edit its name;

C. delete an existing module
this feature should allow the user to select a module from the module list then delete the record from file.
